Today wallpaper is Darlene from Mr. Robot. Enjoy, you get to see her!

## Info
Moved to a (even more) minimalistic setup since I am in a Virtual Machine. Theme and colors are from [wpgtk](https://github.com/deviantfero/wpgtk) for a quick change.


# How to
Use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) to unpack the folders, and it will symlink them to the correct location. This is achieved with the following command:

    stow config
    
By default this will unpack to the folder above the current one, so the repo should be cloned to the home directory.
