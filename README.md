## Info
Moved to an (even more) minimalistic visual setup since I am in a Virtual Machine now. Theme and colors are from 
[wpgtk](https://github.com/deviantfero/wpgtk) for a quick change. Some things are messy, so apologies for that.


## How to
Use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) to unpack the folders, and it will symlink them to the correct location. This is achieved with the following command:

    stow config
    
By default this will unpack to the folder above the current one, so the repo should be cloned to the home directory.

Scripts - Stolen dots have (or should have) credits inside.
