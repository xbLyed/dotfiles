#How to
Use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) to unpack the folders, and it will symlink them to the correct location. This is achieved with the following command:

    stow config
    
By default this will unpack to the folder above the current one, so the repo should be cloned to the home directory.
